    <h1>My hobbies</h1>

    <p>
        I enjoy exploring activities that balance creativity, learning, and relaxation.
        Coding and tech projects are at the core of my hobbies, as I love building and
        experimenting with new ideas. I also enjoy creative design and writing, where I
        get to express imagination through visuals and words. Beyond the screen, I spend
        time reading books to expand my knowledge, listening to music for inspiration, and
        engaging in cultural research to connect with history and traditions. These hobbies
        keep me curious, creative, and well-rounded.
